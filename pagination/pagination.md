# [Pagination](http://bit.ly/1TyCmqD)      

By [definition](http://bit.ly/2C5zdxN) it is: 
> : the action of paging : the condition of being paged     
> : the numbers or marks used to indicate the sequence of pages (as of a book)    

And it's a common problem to be solved when you're going to present data in a table
