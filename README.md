# Purposes

# Table of Content

| Problem        | Status        | 
| -------------  |:-------------:| 
| [Pagination](http://bit.ly/1TyCmqD)     | To Do         | 
| Empty Slot     | To Do         | 

# Pagination

By definition it is, according to [this](http://bit.ly/2C5zdxN): 
> : the action of paging : the condition of being paged     
> : the numbers or marks used to indicate the sequence of pages (as of a book)    

And it's a common problem to be solved when you're going to present data in a table
